// Update Tours component:

// So in the previous task you was use div to render tours as card , but in this task and as you learn in today demo and instead of returning a <div> each time. you must return and render a <Tour/>.
// After that, you have to pass the data as props to the <Tour/ tour={tour} >.and donâ€™t forget to add the id as a key.
// Tour component:

// In the tour component you have to display the same data that you have displayed before which are [ image, name ].
